# Pro Git

A simple repository I used to try the features mentioned in Scott Chacon and Ben Straub's excellent [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book.

To have some files to actually use version control on, I've used a few basic python programs.

Things I've already tried in Git:

* Initiating a new repository.
* Adding untracked and modified files to the next commit.
* Commiting using a commit message in both the CLI and the default editor.
* Commiting while skipping the staging area.
